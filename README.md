# My dotfiles

These are the dotfiles made by me.

## Installation

Make sure `git` and `stow` are installed.
First, check out the dotfiles repository in your $HOME directory using git.

```bash
git clone git@github.com/tbloemen/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

Then use GNU stow to create symlinks.

```bash
stow .
```
